# Television-Show-Guide
  This program is supposed to function like a television guide. The console takes in a 'TVGuide' file to create a ShowList object of the shows available. After this, the user can input a .txt file which contains the shows they are currently watching and the shows on their wishlist (shows they want to watch but are currently not watching). The program will tell them which shows on their wishlist they can and can't watch. The functionality of the ShowList class is tested afterwards but this is not relevant to the real function of the code. This program was coded in Java on the eclipse platform.
